jQuery Notes
============
Content is HTML, Presentation is CSS, Behavior (event handling) is JavaScript.
The APIs in JavaScript are somewhat complex and, until recently, riddled with browser incompatibilities
For these reasons, many or most client-side JavaScript programmers choose to use a client-side library
or framework to simplify their basic programming tasks. The most popular such library is jQuery.
The jQuery library defines a clever and easy-to-use API for scripting document, content, presentation,
and behavior.
jQuery code is easy to identify because it makes frequent use of a function names $().
