Expressions and Statements
==========================

An Expression is a phrase of JS that can be evaluted to produce a value but it doesn't DO anything.
It doesn't alter the program state in anyway.

Statements on the other hand don't have a value (or don't have a value we care about), but DO alter
the program state.

Statement Examples: Declarations, Assignments, and Control structures such as conditionals and loops.
