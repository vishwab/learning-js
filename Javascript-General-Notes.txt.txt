Apps ate the world, the web ate apps, and JavaScript ate the web.

Babel is a compiler for writing next gen Javascript - https://babeljs.io/

A const object can't be reassigned to refer to a completely different object, but the object it refers 
to can have its properties mutated. JavaScript also has the ability to freeze() objects, but those 
objects are only frozen at the root level, meaning that a nested object can still have properties of 
its properties mutated. In other words, there's still a long road ahead before we see true composite 
immutables in the JavaScript specification.

npm is the largest open-source package in the world. This can be used to download/install packages and

ECMAScript
-----------
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript

ECMAScript is a scripting language spec created to standardize JavaScript, so as to foster multiple
independent implementations. JavaScript is the best known implementation of JavaScript. Other 
implementations are JScript and ActionScript.
Coders commonly use ECMAScript for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly 
being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.

ECMAScript (ES6) has been the standard version for JS so far. A new one is out in 2017 which is ES7.


TypeScript is a free and open-source programming lang developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a
strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.
